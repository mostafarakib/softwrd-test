The 3 parts of this project is listed below: 

# Layout
This is a component where I have built a responsive layout using Tailwind CSS grid. One of the boxes of the layout contains a mountain animation which is built by using pure CSS

# Chart
This component shows some informations about different countries in a table. It also shows a polar chart for the top 10 most populated countries. I've used https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all this api to get the country details.
